# Sunwoo Kim

Founder, SecondEarth AI. I build AI-native consumer apps, ship fast, and scale what users pay for.

- **Subscription traction (Dec 28 2025)**: **$3,156 MRR** · **$37,870 ARR**
- **Subscription averages (last 90 days)**: **$2,981 MRR** · **$35,770 ARR**
- **Distribution (2025)**: **151,015 new customers**
- **App Store signal (App Store Connect, Nov 28–Dec 27 2025)**: AIBookCraft **26K impressions / 856 units / $1.32K proceeds / 1.83K sessions** (iOS)
- **Operating mode**: **solo founder**; compact execution, rapid iteration
- **SF**: relocating to **San Francisco in early 2026**
- **Stack**: React Native · AWS Amplify · Amazon Bedrock · Expo · Sentry
- **Growth tooling**: RevenueCat · Mixpanel · OneSignal · Superwall

## What I’m building (now)

### AIBookCraft — AI book writing → publishing

Helps creators go from idea → manuscript → publishable output with an AI-first workflow.

- **Why it wins**: shortens time-to-finished-work (not “chat with an LLM”) and encourages repeat creation.
- **Proof**: real subscriptions + global usage; strong iOS store signal.

### Freelytic — AI-assisted growth insights for creators

I’m building this on the side while scaling AIBookCraft: turns noisy analytics into clear actions creators can execute.

### TripPack AI — personalized itinerary planning

Auto-curated travel plans based on preferences, time, and context—designed to save hours per trip.

## Why this can be big

- **AI is the workflow**: these products are built around end-to-end workflows where output quality and completion matter.
- **Compounding advantages**:
  - **Workflow depth**: the product becomes part of a recurring habit (create → refine → publish).
  - **Distribution loops**: user outputs are inherently shareable (books, itineraries, recommendations).
  - **Iteration speed**: instrumented funnels + lifecycle automation to ship growth experiments quickly.
- **Global-first**: built for international usage from day one.

## What I’m looking for

- **YC / investors**: I’m scaling my strongest wedge into a breakout AI consumer company. I’m moving to SF in early 2026 to build faster with the best network.
- **Potential collaborators**: people who can move fast on product, growth, and systems.
- **Partners**: platforms that power creator or travel workflows.

If you want a quick view, tell me what you want first (traction, revenue, product loop, growth channels) and I’ll share the most relevant numbers and screenshots.

## Open-source (product-driven)

- **onesignal-mcp-server**: automation layer for OneSignal workflows with MCP integration
- **AmplifyQuery**: AWS Amplify (v6+) + React Query helpers I built for shipping RN apps faster — [Sun-Woo-Kim/AmplifyQuery](https://github.com/Sun-Woo-Kim/AmplifyQuery)
